Geo JSON, API, D3 Library, JavaScript


> This project was one of my favorites!!

> Creating MAPS with JavaScript is really fun!!

## Project Overview

The main purpose of the project was to showcase abilities using API and D3 lybrary to show important information about earthquakes around the world. 

In this project i worked with Basin and Sadhana to create a map with two different maps and earthquake overlay. Next we added the tectonic platesÂ´s location on the earth and the magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, finally added the data on a third map, my favorite the "Dark Map". 

## Results 
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
